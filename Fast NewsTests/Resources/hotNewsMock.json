It has served its purpose well for the most part. However, we do realise that by stuffing all the people looking for help into one post - many people weren\\u2019t getting the help they needed in a timely fashion, if at all. We tried different ways of getting more people to help, but to no avail.\n\nFor this reason, as of 08:00am EST today (15/12/2020), we will be deactivating the Support Megathread on r/iOS. All software-related issues will be allowed to be posted to the subreddit as a self-post, granted the issue is described clearly. A megathread will no longer be used. All hardware related issue must go to either r/applehelp or r/iphonehelp. These changes will be trialled for a period of 2-3 weeks and will be reflected in the rules.\n\nYou may be asking why we are making these changes:\n\n**(1)** Well, as stated at the beginning of this post, we realise that oftentimes people weren\\u2019t getting their issues responded to in a timely fashion, if they ever even received an answer. By allowing users to make their own post detailing the issue they need help with - their issue will gain more visibility which increases the chance of their issue being seen and resolved.\n\n**(2)** By the tech support thread being removed, we will be freeing up a sticky spot which we can use for other megathreads (such as an app discovery megathread, or something else - we\\u2019re open to ideas), or for simple announcements.\n\n*(We\\u2019ll be looking into possibly adding on to this new system by having a bot that can flair a post as \\u201cResolved\\u201d when the OP of the support post replies to a user with a solution that worked for them by using a special command like !resolved.)*\n\nWe\\u2019ll monitor these changes and come back after the new year and discuss as a mod team. We may also call a community vote to see if they liked the changes or not. This is merely a trial, so nothing is set in stone yet. No harm in trying different options! Of course, people should really be going to Apple Support for their issues, but we do acknowledge that may not be an option all the time.\n\nWith that being said, this may be the last mod post from us until the new year. I\\u2019d like to extend a massive thank you to everyone on the mod team who\\u2019s been volunteering their time this year to make this a safe and enjoyable community for iOS users from every corner of the globe, and also a huge thanks to all our users. On behalf of the r/iOS mod team, we wish you a well deserved holiday, and a healthy and happy new year!",
